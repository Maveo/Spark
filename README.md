Spark is currently being beta-tested on the [StudeGaming Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MzXV5GYRsN "Join the Discord") and continuous to be enhanced by his developer [skillor](https://github.com/skillor "Visit his github profile"). If you are interested in Sparks development, you can view the project roadmap and history in the [Projects]( https://github.com/skillor/Spark/projects "A deep dive into Sparks development") tab. If you have any suggestions or bug reports and want to help the development process, you are welcome to let us know in the [Issues](https://github.com/skillor/Spark/issues/new/choose "Give us feedback") tab. Spark is currently not publicly avaliable, so can't be easily invited to your Discord server. Should you still want to use Spark on your Discord server, feel free to use it's source code to host it yourself.

## Features

Spark has an evergrowing utility set with numerous advanced features:

 - #### Level System
	The level system tracks users voice-channel and chat activity on the server and rewards them with XP, which enables users to get levels. Server admins are then able to create ranks on certain level targets using the <kbd>/lvlsys set {level target} {role-id}</kbd> command and assign roles, that will  automatically be given to users hitting the stated level target (rank). All parameters like the rate at which users gain XP can be edited in the source code. Furthermore admins can change users levels and XP-multipliers, aswell as blacklisting users from gaining XP using <kbd>/lvlsys</kbd> chat commands.

 - #### Promotion Codes
    Users have to ability to provide new users with a promo code, which rewards the new user with a configurable level headstart and to old user with a temporary configurable xp-multiplier

 - #### Custom Bot Responses
	When a user attempts to use a command without the permission to do so, the bot will deny the interaction and jokingly inform the user with one of 13 different custom text messages. The same will happen when a user executes an unknown command.

 - #### Advanced Command Interaction
	Spark is able to communicate trough Discords slash command integration, which offers a more polished user experience and will help to keep your chat cleaner. Additionally Spark can handle user related commands with @mentions.

 - #### Custom Image Generation
	The Bot is equiped with a custom image generator, which will create custom levelup, rankup, leaderboard and profile-card images. All images can be designed using the build-in design code, that is build similar to knwon webdesign languages like CSS.
