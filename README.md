## Features

#### Spark has an evergrowing utility set with numerous advanced features:

 * ##### Level System
   ###### The level system tracks users voice-channel and chat activity on the server and rewards them with XP, which enables users to get levels. Server admins are then able to create ranks on certain level targets using the <kbd>/lvlsys set {level target} {role-id}</kbd> command and assign roles, that will  automatically be given to users hitting the stated level target (rank). All parameters like the rate at which users gain XP can be edited in the source code. Furthermore admins can change users levels and XP-multipliers, aswell as blacklisting users from gaining XP using <kbd>/lvlsys</kbd> chat commands.
   
 * ##### Custom Bot Responses
   ###### When a user attempts to use a command without the permission to do so, the bot will deny the interaction and jokingly inform the user with one of 13 different custom text messages. The same will happen when a user executes an unknown command.
   
 * ##### Custom Image Generation
   ###### The Bot is equiped with a custom image generator, which will create custom levelup, rankup, leaderboard and profile-card images. All images can be designed using the build-in design code, that is build similar to knwon webdesign languages like CSS.
